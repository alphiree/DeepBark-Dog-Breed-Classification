## DeepBark: Dog Breed Classification

---

-  Developed a deep learning model to accurately predict the breed of dogs, achieving an overall accuracy score of 96% across 70 different dog breeds.

- Employed image localization methods to visualize and interpret the specific areas in the images that influenced the model's predictions, providing insights into the decision-making process.
